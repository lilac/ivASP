Compilation
  in a perfect world just run scons
  gringo 4 requires a very recent C++ compiler 
  such compilers are typically only available in bleeding edge distributions (e.g. Fedora 17)
  most development happens on debian-squeeze with a self-compiled clang/gcc

Requirements
  a c++11 conforming compiler
    gcc 4.7 (earlier versions will not work!)
    clang 3.1 (using either libstdc++ provided by gcc 4.7 or libc++)
    other compilers might work
  the bison parser generator
    version 2.6.2 is recommended
    version 2.5 should work (earlier versions will not work)
  the re2c lexer generator
    version 0.13.5 is recommended
  the scons build system
    version 2.2.0 is recommended
    version 2.1.0 should work

Tweaking Build Options
  run scons --help
  alternatively edit build/<build-dir>.py

Unit Testing
  uses cppunit and is entirely optional
  if libc++ is used,
    cppunit has to be compiled using the same
    to get the name demangling right, libc++abi has to be used
    and cppunit must be patched (just edit the auto-generated config.h)
